This is a template for SQL Injection created only for educational purposes, the use of this for other purposes is the responsibility of the user.
If you're trying to learn and practice SQL Injection then you should already know that, in most cases, you won't be able to apply any other statement rather than SELECT. This is because most websites are currently using mysqli which will prevent attackers from using other statements such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE by limiting the number of queries to one, being most of the time a SELECT query.
With this template you'll be able to use your own database to learn about SQL Injection by practicing how to retrieve information but most important, how to take advantage of a bad implementation of multi_query by using diverse kind of statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE to directly affect the database, something you can't do in most controlled environments.
